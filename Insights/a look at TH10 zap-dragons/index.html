    <p id="textbody">	At Townhall 10 zap dragons is one of the most effective <br> 
			and most used strategies, because of it's ease of use,<br>
    			however it is still effective in townhalls above and below.</p> 
     <p id="textbody">	zap dragons uses lightning-spells to take out air-defenses<br>
			to easilly clear out a base and get 100%.</p>
     <p id="textbody">	zap dragons is so strong in fact that the air defense of <br>
			TH10 was given an extra 10hp just to take one extra zap <br>
			of the level you can unlock at TH10.</p>
<p id="textbody">	However, it should be noted that this doesnt apply to lower<br>
			Town Halls, allowing you to have an easier time attacking TH9s<br>
			due to being able to take out all 4 Air Defenses with spells</p>
<p id="textbody">	To use the strategy you just need to spam lightning on <br> 
			the airdefenses and spam your dragons and some loons to the side of the <br>
			one that's left, which should be the easiest to reach.</p>
<p id="textbody">	If you can take out other buildings while spamming the Lightnings <br> 
			you should prioritze air sweepers and single target inferno-towers.</p> 
<p id="textbody">	I hope this guide helps you a bit with your own TH10 attacks.</p>
